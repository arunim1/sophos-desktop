First, let me extract the key information from the screenshot description:

1. The verifiable credential system involves three roles: holder, issuer, and verifier
2. These three roles operate in a "triangle of trust"
3. The holder mediates between issuer and verifier
4. Trust relationships exist between:
   - Issuer and holder (mutual trust)
   - Holder and verifier (holder trusts verifier)
   - Verifier and issuer (verifier trusts issuer)
5. Any role (holder, issuer, verifier) can be played by:
   - A person
   - An institution
   - An IoT device

Now I'll prioritize this information based on importance:
- The core concept of the "triangle of trust" and the three roles is fundamental
- The specific trust relationships between each role are important details
- The flexibility of who/what can play each role is a supporting concept

For effective flashcards, I'll need to:
1. Make them atomic (focus on one concept per card)
2. Ensure they're future-proof (clear enough to understand later)
3. Follow the minimum information principle (include only essential details)
4. Build upon basics (start with fundamental concepts)

I'll create the following flashcards:
1. Basic card identifying the three roles in the verifiable credential system
2. Cloze card for the "triangle of trust" concept
3. Three basic cards for each trust relationship
4. Basic card for what entities can play the roles

For each card, I'll ensure clarity, conciseness, and adherence to the rules.
